## Description

In cluster scenarios, configures the communication NICs in a communicator. It supports switching communication between a device NIC and a backup NIC on the same NPU, where the backup NIC is the NIC of another die on the same NPU.

When configuring communication NICs in a single operation, all devices in the same communicator must call this API, and the **ranks**, **useBackup**, and **nRanks** parameter configurations delivered by all devices must be consistent.

> [!NOTE] Note
> When configuring the communication NIC, note the impact of the following operations:
>
> - If commands to switch to the backup NIC and to switch to the primary NIC are issued simultaneously, and one end of a link switches to the primary NIC while the other end switches to the backup NIC, the command fails.
> - If a link exists between device 1 and device 2, and the first command switches device 1 to the backup NIC while the second command switches device 2 back to the default NIC, the link between device 1 and device 2 uses the default NIC for communication, while the links between device 1 and other devices use the backup NIC for communication.
> - If the NICs of device 1 and device 2 are each other's backup NICs, and both devices simultaneously issue the command to switch to the backup NIC, the communication NICs used by device 1 and device 2 are swapped.

## Function Prototype

```c
HcclResult HcclCommWorkingDevNicSet(HcclComm comm, uint32_t *ranks, bool *useBackup, uint32_t nRanks)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Input/Output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| comm | Input | Communicator for which the communication NIC is specified.<br>For the definition of the HcclComm type, see [HcclComm](./data_type_definition/HcclComm.md). |
| ranks | Input | Array of rank IDs in the communicator for the ranks whose communication NIC is specified. |
| useBackup | Input | Whether the devices in **ranks** use the backup NIC. |
| nRanks | Input | Number of ranks whose NIC is switched. |

## Return Value

[HcclResult](./data_type_definition/HcclResult.md): The API returns **HCCL_SUCCESS** on success, and other values on failure.

## Constraints

- Before configuration, ensure that the communication tasks in the current environment are complete.
- When ranks in the same communicator call this API, the lengths of the **ranks** and **useBackup** arrays passed in must be consistent with the **nRanks** value.
- The actual NIC switchover occurs only when both of the following conditions are met.
  - Retry is enabled for inter-SuperPoD communication, that is, the **L2** configuration of the environment variable **HCCL_OP_RETRY_ENABLE** is set to **1**.
  - The topology contains RDMA links.

- In unsupported scenarios, for example, when retry is not enabled for **HCCL_OP_RETRY_ENABLE**, **HCCL_SUCCESS** is returned and a WARNING is printed in the log, but the NIC is not actually switched.
- For the same rank, the **HcclCommWorkingDevNicSet** API must be called one by one in order. Concurrent calls are not supported.
- For the entire communicator, when calling **HcclCommWorkingDevNicSet**, ensure that the same delivery order is used across different ranks.
- The communicator pointed to by the **comm** handle must have had operators delivered before NIC configuration can be performed. Subsequently delivered operators of the same type and with the same parameters will continue to use the same NIC configuration, while other newly delivered operators will use the default NIC for communication. If these requirements are not met, NIC configuration will fail.

## Example

```c
HcclComm comm;
uint32_t rankSize = 4;
uint32_t rankIds[rankSize] = {0, 3, 7, 12};
bool useBackup[rankSize] = {true, true, true, true};
HcclCommWorkingDevNicSet(comm, rankIds, useBackup, rankSize);
```
