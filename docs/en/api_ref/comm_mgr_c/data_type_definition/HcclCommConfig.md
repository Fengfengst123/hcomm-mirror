## Description

When initializing a communicator with specific configurations, this data type is used to define the communicator configuration information, including multiple configuration items such as the buffer size, deterministic computation switch, communicator name, communication operator expansion mode, communication algorithm, and symmetric memory reservation.

## Prototype

```c
const uint32_t HCCL_COMM_CONFIG_INFO_BYTES = 24;
const uint32_t COMM_NAME_MAX_LENGTH = 128;
const uint32_t BUFFER_NAME_MAX_LENGTH = 128;
const uint32_t UDI_MAX_LENGTH = 128;
const uint32_t HCCL_COMM_ALGO_MAX_LENGTH = 1600;
const uint32_t HCCL_COMM_RETRY_ENABLE_MAX_LENGTH = 50;
const uint32_t HCCL_COMM_RETRY_PARAMS_MAX_LENGTH = 128;
typedef struct HcclCommConfigDef {
    char reserved[HCCL_COMM_CONFIG_INFO_BYTES];    /* Reserved field, which cannot be modified. */
    uint32_t hcclBufferSize;
    uint32_t hcclDeterministic;

} HcclCommConfig;
```

## Parameters

- **hcclBufferSize**: buffer size of the shared data. It must be configured as an integer greater than or equal to 1, in MB. For the value range and usage constraints for different product types, see the environment variable [HCCL_BUFFSIZE](https://gitcode.com/cann/hccl/blob/master/docs/zh/user_guide/hccl_env/HCCL_BUFFSIZE.md).

  Note the following:

  - This configuration item has a higher priority than the **HCCL_BUFFSIZE** environment variable.
  - The memory requested by this configuration item is exclusively used by HCCL and cannot be reused by other service memory.
  - A communicator created based on this configuration item exclusively occupies memory of "2 × **hcclBufferSize**", ensuring that concurrent operators of multiple communicators do not affect each other.
  - For collective communication operators, performance may degrade when the data size exceeds this configured value. It is recommended that the **hcclBufferSize** value be greater than the data size.

- **hcclDeterministic**: deterministic computation switch, supported on the following models:

  The following lists the supported values and their meanings for different AI processors. Values not listed are not supported.

  <!-- npu="950" id1 -->
  - Ascend 950PR&950DT products: This configuration is not supported. You can configure the global deterministic computation switch through the **HCCL_DETERMINISTIC** environment variable.
  <!-- end id1 -->

  <!-- npu="910b,A3" id2 -->
  - Atlas A2 products and Atlas A3 products: The supported values and their meanings are as follows:
    - **0** (default): Disables deterministic computation.
    - **1**: Enables deterministic computation for reduction communication operators, including AllReduce, ReduceScatter, Reduce, and ReduceScatterV.
    - **2**: Enables strict deterministic computation for reduction communication operators, that is, the order preservation function (ensuring that the reduction order of all bits is consistent on the basis of determinism). The supported communication operators are AllReduce, ReduceScatter, and ReduceScatterV. When this parameter is set to this value, the following conditions must be met:
      - Only multi-server symmetric distribution scenarios are supported. Asymmetric distribution scenarios are not supported.
      - When order preservation is enabled, the saturation mode is not supported. Only the INF/NaN mode is supported.
      - Compared with deterministic computation, enabling order preservation causes a certain degree of performance degradation. It is recommended to use this function in inference scenarios.
  <!-- end id2 -->

    > [!NOTE] Note
    > When deterministic computation is not enabled, the results of multiple executions may differ. This difference generally comes from asynchronous multi-thread execution in the operator implementation, which causes the accumulation order of floating-point numbers to change. When deterministic computation is enabled, the operator produces the same output across multiple executions under the same hardware and input.
    > By default, deterministic computation does not need to be enabled. However, when you find that a model produces different results across multiple executions or during precision tuning, you can enable deterministic computation to assist debugging and tuning. Note that after it is enabled, the operator execution time increases, causing performance degradation.

- **hcclCommName**: communicator name, with a maximum length of 128.

  **Note:**

  - The specified communicator name must be unique among all communicators. If it is not specified, HCCL automatically generates one.
  - When the communicator operator expansion mode is configured as CCU, the operator internally creates a communicator with the suffix "_negotiation" to ensure the consistency of CCU resource usage across different ranks. When specifying a communicator name, avoid ending it with "_negotiation" to prevent duplicate communicator names.

- **hcclUdi**: User-defined information, with a maximum length of 128. It is left empty by default.
- **hcclOpExpansionMode**: Configures the expansion mode of communication operators. This is a communicator-level configuration.

  The following lists the supported values and their meanings for different AI processors. Values not listed are not supported.

  <!-- npu="950" id4 -->
  **For Ascend 950PR&950DT products, the supported values and their meanings are as follows:**

  - **0**: Uses the default operator expansion mode. For **Ascend 950PR&950DT products**, communication operators are expanded on the AI CPU compute unit by default.
  - **2**: Communication operators are expanded on the AI CPU compute unit and scheduled by the STARS scheduler.

    This configuration item supports the Broadcast, Reduce, AllReduce, Scatter, ReduceScatter, ReduceScatterV, AllGather, AllGatherV, AlltoAll, AlltoAllV, AlltoAllVC, Send, Recv, and BatchSendRecv operators.

    In graph mode (Ascend IR) or graph capture (aclgraph) scenarios, when the communication algorithm uses the AI CPU mode, the number of concurrent graphs on a single card cannot exceed 6. Otherwise, communication may be blocked because the AI CPU cores are fully occupied.

  - **3**: Communication operators are expanded on the Vector Core compute unit on the device side.
    - This configuration supports only symmetric networking and the inference feature.
    - In this configuration, if the data size does not meet the running requirements on Vector Core, some operators automatically switch to the default mode.
    - This configuration supports only the Broadcast, Reduce, AllReduce, ReduceScatter, Scatter, AllGather, AlltoAll, AlltoAllV, and AlltoAllVC operators, and currently supports only the single-server scenario.
      - For the Reduce, AllReduce, and ReduceScatter operators, the supported data types are int8, int16, int32, int64, float16, float32, and bfp16.

    - Under this configuration item, the core control capability is supported. It is recommended that you configure the number of Vector Cores based on the concurrency of computation operators and communication operators in the actual usage scenario.

  - **4**: The communication operator is expanded on the Vector Core compute unit on the device side, but mode switching does not occur as the data size changes. Vector Core is always used for computation. If the running conditions of Vector Core are not met, an error is reported and the process exits.
    - This configuration supports only symmetric networking and the inference feature.
    - For the operators supported by this configuration and the constraints, see configuration "3".

  - **5**: The communication operator is expanded on the Collective Communication Unit (CCU) and uses the Memory Slice (MS) mode. Ascend 950PR does not support this configuration.

    The MS mode uses the on-chip MS of the CCU as an intermediate buffer when communicating with multiple remote ends, to save memory read/write bandwidth. MS is characterized by a small size but high speed. When CCU resources are insufficient, the system automatically switches to "2: AI CPU mode".
    - This configuration supports only the Broadcast, Reduce, AllReduce, ReduceScatter, AllGather, AllGatherV, and ReduceScatterV operators, and currently supports only the single-server scenario.
      - For the Broadcast, AllGather, and AllGatherV operators, the supported data types are int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, int64, uint64, float16, float32, float64, and bfp16.
      - For the Reduce, AllReduce, ReduceScatter, and ReduceScatterV operators, the supported data types are int16, int32, float16, float32, and bfp16.

  - **6**: The communication operator is expanded on the CCU and uses the scheduling mode.

    The scheduling mode uses the CCU as a scheduler to schedule UB WQE tasks to the UB engine. In the scheduling mode, the on-chip MS of the CCU is not used, and HBM-to-HBM data transfer is performed directly between two ranks.

    For the AllReduce, ReduceScatter, and Reduce operators in single-server communication scenarios, when the data size exceeds a certain value, the system automatically switches to "2: AI_CPU mode" to prevent performance degradation (this threshold is not fixed and is adjusted based on factors such as the operator running mode and network scale).

    In this mode, the ReduceScatterV and AllGatherV operators support only the single-server scenario.

    When CCU resources are insufficient, the system automatically switches to "2: AI CPU mode".
  <!-- end id4 -->

  <!-- npu="A3" id5 -->

  - **3**: Communication operators are expanded on the Vector Core compute unit on the device side.
    - This configuration supports only symmetric networking and the inference feature.

      - For the AllGather, AlltoAll, AlltoAllV, and AlltoAllVC operators, the supported data types are int8, uint8, int16, uint16, int32, uint32, float16, float32, and bfp16. Only single-server and multi-server communication within a SuperPoD is supported. Cross-SuperPoD communication is not supported.

    - For the Broadcast, AllReduce, ReduceScatter, AllGather, and AlltoAll (single-server communication scenario) operators, when the data size exceeds a certain value, the system automatically switches to "2: AI CPU mode" to prevent performance degradation (this threshold is not fixed and is adjusted based on factors such as the operator running mode, whether deterministic computation is enabled, and the network scale). For the AlltoAllV, AlltoAllVC, and AlltoAll (multi-server communication scenario) operators, the system does not automatically switch to "2: AI CPU" mode. To avoid performance deterioration, when the maximum communication data size between any two ranks does not exceed 1 MB, it is recommended to configure "3: AIV mode"; otherwise, use "2: AI CPU mode".
    - Under this configuration item, collective communication supports the core control capability. It is recommended that you configure the number of Vector Cores based on the concurrency of computation operators and communication operators in the actual usage scenario.

      - For the Broadcast operator, it is recommended to allocate at least ranksize Vector Cores.
      - For the AllGather and non-deterministic ReduceScatter operators, it is recommended to allocate at least max\(2, ceil\(ranksize/20\)\) Vector Cores.
      - For the AllReduce, deterministic ReduceScatter, AlltoAll, AlltoAllV, and AlltoAllVC operators, it is recommended to allocate at least max\(2, ceil\(ranksize/20\)\) Vector Cores, and the number of cores must be an even number (if the calculated result is an odd number, round it up to the next even number).

      If the number of Vector Cores allocated during service compilation cannot meet the algorithm orchestration requirements, HCCL reports an error and prompts the minimum number of Vector Cores required.

  - **4**: The communication operator is expanded on the Vector Core compute unit on the device side, but mode switching does not occur as the data size changes. Vector Core is always used for computation. If the running conditions of Vector Core are not met, an error is reported and the process exits.

    > <!-- end id8 -->

- **hcclRdmaTrafficClass**: Configures the traffic class of the RDMA NIC. The value range is \[0, 255\], and the value must be an integer multiple of 4.

  In the RoCE V2 protocol, this value corresponds to the Type of Service (ToS) field in the IP packet header. It has 8 bits in total, where bits\[0,1\] are fixed to 0 and bits\[2,7\] are the DSCP. Therefore, dividing this value by 4 yields the DSCP value.

  **Note:**

  - 0xFFFFFFFF is used as the priority determination flag. When this value is configured as 0xFFFFFFFF, the configuration of this communicator is invalid, and the environment variable configuration or the default value **132** is used according to the priority.

- **hcclRdmaServiceLevel**: Configures the service level of the RDMA NIC. The value must be consistent with the PFC priority configured on the NIC. Inconsistent configuration may cause performance deterioration.

  The value must be an unsigned integer in the range \[0, 7\].

  **Note:**

  - 0xFFFFFFFF is used as the priority determination flag. When the value is configured as 0xFFFFFFFF, this communicator configuration is invalid, and the environment variable configuration or the default value **4** is used according to the priority.

- **hcclWorldRankID**: a field used in Network Scale Load Balance-Data Plane (NSLB-DP) scenarios. It represents the global rank ID of the current process in the AI framework (such as PyTorch).

  **Note:**

  - Ascend 950PR&950DT products do not support this configuration.

- **hcclJobID**: a field used in NSLB-DP scenarios, representing the unique identifier of the current distributed service, generated by the AI framework.

  **Note:**

  - Ascend 950PR&950DT products do not support this configuration.

- **aclGraphZeroCopyEnable**: This parameter takes effect only for Reduce-type operators in graph capture mode (aclgraph) and controls whether to enable zero-copy.
  - **0** (default): Disables zero-copy.
  - **1**: Enables zero-copy.

  **Note:**

  - Ascend 950PR&950DT products do not support this configuration.

- **hcclExecTimeOut**: During distributed training or inference, different device processes may execute tasks inconsistently across devices (for example, only specific processes save checkpoint data). This parameter controls the synchronization wait time for execution between devices. Within the configured time, each device process waits for other devices to perform communication synchronization. The unit is s. For the value range and usage constraints for different product types, see the environment variable [HCCL_EXEC_TIMEOUT](https://gitcode.com/cann/hccl/blob/master/docs/zh/user_guide/hccl_env/HCCL_EXEC_TIMEOUT.md).

  **Configuration example:**

    ```text
    # Configure an integer number of seconds. Set it to 1800s.
    hcclExecTimeOut = 1800
    # Configure with ten-millisecond precision. Set it to 50ms.
    hcclExecTimeOut = 0.05
    ```

  **Note:**

  - 0xFFFFFFFF is used as the priority determination flag. When it is configured as 0xFFFFFFFF, this communicator configuration is invalid, and the environment variable configuration or the default value **1836** is used according to the priority.
  - Ascend 950PR&950DT products do not support this configuration. You can configure the global timeout through the **HCCL_EXEC_TIMEOUT** environment variable.

- **hcclAlgo**: used to configure the inter-server communication algorithm and the inter-SuperPoD communication algorithm for collective communication. It supports two configuration modes: configuring the algorithm type globally and configuring the algorithm type by operator. Note that HCCL provides an adaptive algorithm selection function, which selects an appropriate algorithm by default based on the product form, data size, and number of servers. Generally, you do not need to specify an algorithm manually. If you specify an inter-server communication algorithm through this parameter, the adaptive algorithm selection function no longer takes effect.

  For the parameter information of the configuration modes and the algorithm types supported by different product types, see the environment variable [HCCL_ALGO](https://gitcode.com/cann/hccl/blob/master/docs/zh/user_guide/hccl_env/HCCL_ALGO.md).

- **hcclRetryEnable**: used to configure whether to enable the retry feature of HCCL operators. Retry means that when a communication operator reports an SDMA or RDMA CQE error during execution, HCCL attempts to retry this communication operator. **It is supported only on Atlas A3 products.**

  Through this parameter, developers can configure whether to enable the retry feature in communicators at two physical levels: inter-server and inter-SuperPoD. Each level supports two states: enabled or disabled. For usage constraints, see the environment variable [HCCL_OP_RETRY_ENABLE](https://gitcode.com/cann/hccl/blob/master/docs/zh/user_guide/hccl_env/HCCL_OP_RETRY_ENABLE.md). The configuration format is `hcclRetryEnable = "L1:1, L2:0"`. The parameter values are as follows:

  - L1 indicates that the physical scope of the communicator is the inter-server communicator. Value **0** indicates that retry is not enabled for inter-server communication tasks within the communicator, and value **1** indicates that retry is enabled for inter-server communication tasks within the communicator. The default value is **0**.
  - L2 indicates that the physical scope of the communicator is the inter-SuperPoD communicator. Value **0** indicates that retry is not enabled for inter-SuperPoD communication tasks within the communicator, and value **1** indicates that retry is enabled for inter-SuperPoD communication tasks within the communicator. The default value is **0**.

- **hcclRetryParams**: This parameter can be used to configure the wait time before the first retry, the maximum number of retries, and the interval between two retries only when developers have enabled the HCCL operator retry feature through the **hcclRetryEnable** parameter. **It is supported only on Atlas A3 products.**

  For usage constraints, see the environment variable [HCCL_OP_RETRY_PARAMS](https://gitcode.com/cann/hccl/blob/master/docs/zh/user_guide/hccl_env/HCCL_OP_RETRY_PARAMS.md). The configuration format is `hcclRetryParams = "MaxCnt:3, HoldTime:5000, IntervalTime:1000"`. The parameter values are as follows:

  - **MaxCnt**: maximum number of retries. The value is of the uint32 type, the value range is \[1, 10\], and the default value is **1**.
  - **HoldTime**: waiting time from the detection of a communication operator execution failure to the start of the first retry. The value is of the uint32 type, the value range is \[0, 60000\], the default value is **5000**, and the unit is ms.
  - **IntervalTime**: interval between two retries of the same communication operator. The value is of the uint32 type, the value range is \[0, 60000\], the default value is **1000**, and the unit is ms.

- **hcclBufferName**: CCLBuffer name. Multiple communicators that use the same buffer name share the same CCLBuffer. If this parameter is not specified, the buffer is not shared by default. The maximum length is 128. Note that communicators that pass in the same CCLBuffer name must deliver operators to the same stream.

  **Note:**

  - This configuration is not supported on Ascend 950PR&950DT products.

- **hcclQos**: Used to configure the hyperplane QoS level. Value range: \[0, 7\].

   For Ascend 950PR&950DT products, the default value is **4**.
   For Atlas A3 products and Atlas A2 products, the default value is **6**.

- **hcclSymWinMaxMemSizePerRank**: In the HCCS scenario of Atlas A3 products, this parameter specifies the symmetric memory size reserved for each rank in the current communicator, in GB. Value range: \[1, the maximum physical memory size that can be allocated in the current environment\], with a default value of **16**. This parameter takes effect only in the HCCS scenario of Atlas A3 products. In the URMA scenario of Ascend 950PR&950DT products, the allocated device memory is used to register the symmetric memory window, and the reserved symmetric memory size does not depend on this parameter.

- **hcclChannelSqDepth**: used to configure the depth of the communication send queue (SQ). Currently, it is supported only in the A5 scenario, and configurable only in the AIV expansion mode and under the UB_CTP and UB_RTP protocols. The configured value is rounded up to the nearest power of 2, and the adjusted effective value range is [16, the device's max_jfs_depth]. In other scenarios, it remains an invalid value.


## Configuration Priority

The preceding configurations are at the communicator level. For some parameters, HCCL also provides global environment variable configuration. The priority is as follows:

- The communicator-level configuration (**HcclCommConfig**) takes precedence over environment variables.

  If a parameter is configured in **HcclCommConfig**, the configured value takes effect.

- Environment variables have the next highest priority.

  If the corresponding parameter is not configured in **HcclCommConfig** but the environment variable is set, the value of the environment variable is used.

- The default value takes effect last.

  If neither **HcclCommConfig** nor the environment variable is configured, the default value listed in the following table is used.

**Table 1** Configuration priority details
