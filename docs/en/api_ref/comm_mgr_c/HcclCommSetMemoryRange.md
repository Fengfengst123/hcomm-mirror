## Description

After a user successfully reserves virtual memory by calling the **aclrtReserveMemAddress** API, the user can call this API to notify HCCL of the reserved virtual memory address. After this API is called, the virtual memory is visible to all communicators in the current process.

## Function Prototype

```c
HcclResult HcclCommSetMemoryRange(HcclComm comm, void *baseVirPtr, size_t size, size_t alignment, uint64_t flags)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Input/Output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| comm | Input | HCCL communicator. It is recommended to use the largest communicator in the server, that is, the communicator covering the maximum number of devices. |
| baseVirPtr | Input | Base address of the virtual memory to be reserved, that is, the virtual memory address output by the **aclrtReserveMemAddress** API. |
| size | Input | Size of the virtual memory, in bytes. |
| alignment | Input | Reserved field.<br>Currently, only **0** is supported. |
| flags | Input | Reserved field.<br>Currently, only **0** is supported. |

## Return Value

[HcclResult](./data_type_definition/HcclResult.md): The API returns **HCCL_SUCCESS** on success, and other values on failure.

## Constraints

- When this API is called for the first time within a communicator, a link establishment operation is performed. Therefore, when calling this API for the first time, ensure that all processes in the communicator call this API at the same time to avoid link establishment timeout. This constraint does not apply to subsequent calls.
- This API can be called only within a communicator whose scope is a single server. Otherwise, an error is reported.
- When this API is called multiple times, the input memory addresses must not be duplicated or have overlapping ranges.
- For other constraints, see [General Constraints](./zero_copy_readme.md).

## Example

```c
// Initialize device resources.
aclInit(NULL);
aclrtSetDevice(devId);

// Create the communicator.
HcclComm hcclComm;
HcclRootInfo rootInfo;
HcclGetRootInfo(&rootInfo);
HcclCommInitRootInfo(8, &rootInfo, 0, &hcclComm);

// Allocate virtual memory through aclrtReserveMemAddress.
void *baseVirPtr = NULL;
size_t size = 1024 * 1024 * 1024; // 1GB
aclrtReserveMemAddress(&baseVirPtr, size, 0, NULL, 0);

// Notify HCCL of the reserved virtual memory address.
HcclCommSetMemoryRange(hcclComm, baseVirPtr, size, 0, 0);

// Later, HcclCommActivateCommMemory can be called to activate the memory and use the zero-copy feature.
// ...

// Destroy the communicator.
HcclCommDestroy(hcclComm);
aclFinalize();
```
