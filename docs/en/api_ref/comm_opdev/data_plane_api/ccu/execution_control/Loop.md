## Description

Hands the loop body to the CCU LoopEngine hardware unit for automatic iteration. This API is a hardware loop class in the CCU kernel. When a `ccu::Loop` object is constructed, the body is recorded immediately (the body lambda is executed once during construction). At runtime, the hardware automatically advances the iteration, so there is no need to manually write address increment or counter update logic in the body.

Compared with a software loop ([CCU_WHILE](CCU_WHILE.md)), a hardware loop does not re-execute the body instructions in each iteration. Instead, the LoopEngine hardware unit automatically advances the address/buffer/event by offset. It is suitable for scenarios with a large number of iterations of the same structure where the body contains only local data movement operations, with minimal instruction overhead.

> [!CAUTION] Caution
> Constructing `ccu::Loop` alone only records the body and does not actually deliver the hardware loop instruction. You must add `Loop` to [`ccu::LoopGroup`](LoopGroup.md). During the registration phase, `LoopGroup` writes parameters such as `iterNum / addrOffset` and synthesizes the hardware loop instruction, after which the hardware actually iterates according to the configuration. If you write `Loop l(cfg, body);` directly without adding it to any LoopGroup, the body is executed only once (during recording at registration), and no loop effect is produced at runtime.

## Class Definition

```cpp
namespace AscendC {
namespace ccu {

class Loop {
public:
    // Construction method 1: config-based (iteration parameters are known at registration).
    Loop(const CcuLoopConfig &loopCfg, const Func &func);

    // Construction method 2: var-based (iteration parameters are determined by a variable at runtime).
    Loop(Variable &loopCfg, const Func &func);
};

} // namespace ccu
} // namespace AscendC
```

## Parameters

### Construction Method 1: config-based

| Parameter | Input/Output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| loopCfg | Input | Loop configuration. The type is `CcuLoopConfig`. For the meaning of each field, see the following table. The iteration count and address offset are determined during kernel registration. |
| func | Input | Loop body. The type is `ccu::Func`, which must be a `Func` with no input parameters (a lambda with no parameters). During construction, the body lambda is executed once immediately. |

### Construction Method 2: var-based

| Parameter | Input/Output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| loopCfg | Input | Loop configuration. The type is `ccu::Variable`. Parameters such as the iteration count are determined by the variable value at runtime. This parameter contains 64 bits, where [12:0] indicates the iteration count of the loop, [44:13] indicates the address offset used by data transfer instructions in each iteration of the loop, data address = value of the address register + [44:13] × iteration count, and [52:45] indicates **EngineID** used by the loop. The user must fill in 0, and the runtime framework fills in this value. |
| func | Input | Same as construction method 1. |

### CcuLoopConfig

Fields in the parameter structure used by the config-based construction method are as follows:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `addrOffset` | `uint64_t` | Number of bytes by which `Address` in the body is automatically offset per iteration. |
| `iterNum` | `uint64_t` | Total number of iterations. |

## Exceptions

When `ccu::Loop` fails to be constructed, an exception is thrown (carrying the [CcuResult](../../../datatype_definition/CcuResult.md) error code). Common causes:

| Cause | Error Code |
| --- | --- |
| The lambda of `func` has input parameters (Loop requires a lambda with no parameters). | `CCU_E_PARA` |
| Insufficient hardware resources, etc. | `CCU_E_UNAVAIL`, etc. |

## Constraints

- During construction of `ccu::Loop`, the body is recorded immediately. After construction is complete, no more content can be appended to the loop.
- The `Func` lambda of the body must have no input parameters. If it has input parameters, an exception is thrown during construction.
- The loop body has the following restrictions:
  - Will be rejected (returns `CCU_E_NOT_SUPPORT`): Neither of the two overloads of [EventRecord](../synchronization/EventRecord.md), namely `EventRecord(Event)` and `EventRecord(const char*)` (that is, [LocalNotifyRecord](../synchronization/LocalNotifyRecord.md)), is available in the body.
  - Will throw an exception (error code `CCU_E_INTERNAL`): calling [CallFunc](CallFunc.md) (`ccu::CallFunc<F>`) in the body.
  - Nesting software control flow macros such as [CCU_IF](CCU_IF.md), [CCU_WHILE](CCU_WHILE.md), and [CCU_DO](CCU_DO.md) in the body is not allowed.
  - It is recommended to avoid calling [NotifyRecord](../synchronization/NotifyRecord.md) and [WriteVariableWithNotify](../synchronization/WriteVariableWithNotify.md) in the body. These two APIs do not report errors in the body, but the loop body is expanded in parallel, and the remote notify semantics are not unique in a parallel environment. Use them with caution.
- `ccu::Loop` must be added to `ccu::LoopGroup` before a hardware loop instruction can be delivered (for details, see [Description](#description)). Do not use it alone.
- A `ccu::Loop` object cannot be added to a `ccu::LoopGroup` repeatedly.
- When constructing `ccu::Loop` in the var-based manner, ensure that the value of `loopCfg` meets the runtime expectation, where bits [12:0] indicate the expected number of iterations, bits [44:13] indicate the expected address offset per iteration, and bits [52:45] indicate the **EngineID**. This **EngineID** must be reserved as 0 and the framework automatically assigns the **EngineID**.

## Example

```cpp
using namespace AscendC::ccu;

// Scenario: Move four consecutive 4 KB data blocks from HBM to the MS Buffer in sequence.
// The hardware loop automatically advances the address by addrOffset, so there is no need to manually increment the address.
CcuResult MyKernel(CcuKernelArg arg) {
    Variable r1, numA, numB;
    numA = 10;
    numB = 20;

    // Define the body: a lambda with no input parameters.
    Func body([&] {
        r1 = numA + numB;   // Perform addition in each iteration.
    });

    // config-based: fix 4 iterations, with the address offset by 4096 bytes per iteration.
    CcuLoopConfig cfg;
    cfg.addrOffset = 4096;
    cfg.iterNum = 4;
    Loop l(cfg, body);   // The body is recorded immediately at construction (but only the IR is recorded, and no hardware loop instruction is issued).

    // Key: It must be added to a LoopGroup before the loop instruction is actually issued.
    CcuLoopGroupConfig grpCfg{};   // In a single-Loop scenario, set all fields to 0.
    LoopGroup g(grpCfg, /*maxLoopNum=*/1, {l});

    return CCU_SUCCESS;
}
```
