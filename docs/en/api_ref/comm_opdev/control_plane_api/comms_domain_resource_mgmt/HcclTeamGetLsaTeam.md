## Description

Obtains the UB Memory LSA WorldTeam handle pre-created during communicator initialization. This handle can be used to convert between LSA team member numbers and communicator rank IDs, and to use UB Memory symmetric memory together with [HcclSymWinGetPeerPointer](../../../comm_mgr_c/HcclSymWinGetPeerPointer.md).

## Function Prototype

```c
HcclResult HcclTeamGetLsaTeam(HcclComm comm, HcommTeamHandle *lsaTeam)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Input/Output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| comm | Input | Initialized communicator handle, which cannot be **NULL**. For the definition of the HcclComm type, see [HcclComm](../../../comm_mgr_c/data_type_definition/HcclComm.md). |
| lsaTeam | Output | Pointer to the LSA WorldTeam handle, which cannot be **NULL**. The returned handle is managed by **comm**. For the definition of the HcommTeamHandle type, see [HcommTeamHandle](../../datatype_definition/HcommTeamHandle.md). |

## Return Value

| Return Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| HCCL_SUCCESS | The LSA WorldTeam is obtained successfully. |
| HCCL_E_PTR | comm or lsaTeam is NULL. |
| HCCL_E_NOT_SUPPORT | comm is not a CommunicatorV2 communicator. |
| HCCL_E_NOT_FOUND | No LSA WorldTeam is pre-created in the communicator. |
| HCCL_E_INTERNAL | The LSA WorldTeam metadata is abnormal. |

## Constraints

1. Only CommunicatorV2 communicators are supported.
2. The communicator must successfully pre-create the UB Memory LSA WorldTeam during initialization; otherwise, **HCCL_E_NOT_FOUND** is returned.
3. The returned LSA WorldTeam is owned by the communicator, and the caller must not destroy it separately through **HcclTeamDestroy**. After the communicator is destroyed, the handle becomes invalid.

## Example

```c
HcommTeamHandle lsaTeam = NULL;
HcclResult ret = HcclTeamGetLsaTeam(comm, &lsaTeam);
if (ret != HCCL_SUCCESS) {
    return ret;
}
```
